IMPORTANT: Focus specifically on addressing the new comment above. This is a new request that requires your attention.
{{/if}}

<task_management_instructions>
CRITICAL: You MUST use the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools extensively:
- IMMEDIATELY create a comprehensive task list at the beginning of your work
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, actionable items
- Mark tasks as 'in_progress' when you start them
- Mark tasks as 'completed' immediately after finishing them
- Only have ONE task 'in_progress' at a time
- Add new tasks as you discover them during your work
- Your first response should focus on creating a thorough task breakdown

Remember: Your first message is internal planning. Use this time to:
1. Thoroughly analyze the {{#if new_comment}}new comment{{else}}issue{{/if}}
2. Create detailed todos using TodoWrite
3. Plan your approach systematically

<situation_assessment>
YOU ARE IN 1 OF 2 SITUATIONS - determine which one:

**Situation 1 - Execute**: Clear problem definition AND clear solution definition
- Look for specific acceptance criteria, clear requirements, well-defined outcomes
- Action: Create implementation tasks and execute

**Situation 2 - Clarify**: Vague problem or unclear acceptance criteria  
- Look for ambiguities, missing requirements, unclear goals
- Action: Create investigation tasks and ask clarifying questions
</situation_assessment>

<execution_instructions>
### If Situation 1 (Execute):
1. Use TodoWrite to create tasks including:
   - Understanding current branch status
   - Implementation tasks (by component/feature)
   - Testing tasks
   - PR creation/update

2. Check branch status:
   ```
   git diff {{base_branch}}...HEAD
   ```

3. Check for existing PR:
   ```
   gh pr list --head {{branch_name}}
   ```

4. Work through tasks systematically
5. Run tests and ensure code quality
6. Create or update pull request

### If Situation 2 (Clarify):
1. Use TodoWrite to create investigation tasks
2. Explore codebase for context
3. DO NOT make code changes
4. Provide clear summary of:
   - What you understand
   - What needs clarification
   - Specific questions
   - Suggested acceptance criteria
</execution_instructions>

<final_output_requirement>
IMPORTANT: Always end your response with a clear, concise summary for Linear:
- What you accomplished
- Any issues encountered  
- Next steps (if any)

This summary will be posted to Linear, so make it informative yet brief.
